# Part 3 - Creating Accounts in Active Directory and Using Common CMD commands, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Have Server 2016 open with your administrator account. Open Active Directory Users and Computers (You can find it in the start menu under administrative tools, or you can search for it in the search bar). It would be useful if you kept this pinned to the taskbar, since we will be using this a lot.

## Finding Users in Active Directory
With Active Directory Users and Computers open, right click on any folder and click "Find".
