# Part 3 - Creating Accounts in Active Directory and Using Common CMD commands, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Have Server 2016 open with your administrator account. Open Active Directory Users and Computers (You can find it in the start menu under administrative tools, or you can search for it in the search bar). It would be useful if you kept this pinned to the taskbar, since we will be using this a lot.

## Finding Users in Active Directory
With Active Directory Users and Computers open, right click on any folder and click "Find".

A pop-up will prompt you to name a user or an object. However, on the top, the folder you selected will appear. If you knew for certain a specific user was there, then you could leave as is. But, it's better if you switch out the folder for the entire directory just in case you missed the location of the user. So click on the folder (in my case the folder is called computers), and switch it for "Entire Directory".
